      Apple Inc. used to be called Apple Computer, Inc., but Apple changed their name after introducing the original iPhone.[5]

      <h2>General history</h2><hr>
      Apple was started in 1976 by Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak.[6]
      Before they made the company, they sold "blue boxes", which had telephone buttons on them. 
      People could use them to make telephone calls from payphones without paying any money. 
      It did this by pretending to be a telephone operator. 
      The company's first product is now called the Apple I computer. 
      They were almost ready to sell it, but a problem happened. 
      Steve Wozniak was working for the computer company Hewlett-Packard, and the papers that said he could work there said he had to give everything he invented to the company before he could do what he wanted to do with it. 
      He showed the first Apple I to the boss at Hewlett-Packard, but they did not want his computer. 
      Wozniak was then free to do what he wanted to do with the Apple I. 
      It began selling in 1976. In 1977, they made their second computer, called the Apple II, a home computer which later became very successful compared to Apple I.
